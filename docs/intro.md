This module contains notes on how ElGamal encryption works and how its additive homomorphic
property may be exploited. It introduces the zero knowledge proofs currently available in the library.

Table of Contents
=================
These notes explain how the ElGamal encryption works, where we'll cover the following topics:

* [ElGamal cryptosystem](::notes::elgamal_cryptosystem)
* [Zero Knowledge Proofs](::notes::zkps)
    * Proof of correct decryption
    * Proof ok knowledge of secret key
    
Notation
========
We introduce the notation used throughout the documentation.

Let \\({\mathbb G}\\) denote the Ristretto group with primer order \\(p\\) generated by generator \\(G\\). We write
\\({\mathbb Z\_p}\\) to denote te integers modulo \\(p\\). We write \\(a\leftarrow A\\) to denote that \\(a\\) is 
chosen uniformly at random from the set \\(A\\).
